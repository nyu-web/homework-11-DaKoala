# Why Is RARRA The Choice?

The biggest difference between AARRR and RARRA funnels is the priority of acquisition. Acquisition ranks first when it comes to priority in AARRR funnel but ranks last in RARRA funnel. The reason is that as time goes, the efficiency of transforming a factor in the funnel to profit changes. When AARRR came up in 2007, on average, user stickness of products is relatively high so the reward of user traffic is high. However nowadays the world is filled with advertisements, user traffic becomes more and more worthless. Since there are so many choices for users, producing a application standing out in the homogenizing market becomes the key factor of success. In this case, RARRA is a better funnel to be applied. Applications lose their users rapidly, but it is core users that contribute to the profit. RARRA is the model aims at generating core users and is the one should be embraced currently.
